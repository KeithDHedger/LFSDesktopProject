      <div align="center"><b><font size="+1">Why another text editor?</font></b><br>
        <br>
        <font size="-1">Simple, I didn't like any of the others they
          were all too flat ( sorry wrong sketch! ), anyway having used
          gedit for years it was getting increasingly difficult to keep
          it compiling without loads of gnome dependencies, looking
          around Linux text editors seem to be VERY simple (leafpad)
          stupidly complex (GVim,Bluefish), trying to be all things to
          all people. <br>
          One of the best text editors I have used is BBEdit but that is
          only available on the mac, so I bit the bullet and decided to
          write my own with the best bits from BBEdit ( the name KKEdit
          is a tip of the hat to BBEdit ), gedit and leafpad. A simple
          uncluttered interface, no major dependencies, with just the
          features I use all the time, and TA DAH! KKEdit.</font><br>
        <br>
        <b><font size="+1">What it's not! </font></b><br>
        <br>
        <font size="-1">KKEdit is NOT a word processor or a web page
          editor, it is NOT and IDE! It won't right code for you, it
          wont insist on inserting brackets ( REALLY annoying! ), it
          wont force you to use any particular style, it doesn't need
          you to break all your fingers trying to hit weird and
          wonderful key combo's and it is not tied to one particular
          distro, oh yes and it won't cost you a penny! </font><br>
        <br>
        <b><font size="+1">What it is and does <br>
          </font></b> <br>
        <font size="-1">KKEdit is a deceptively simple text editor with
          syntax colouring. <br>
          It also has a function menu which allows you to jump instantly
          to a function definition, a navigation menu which will look in
          all open files for a function definition and then switch to
          that tab and go to the relevant line if it can't find a
          definition in any open files it will do a recursive search
          from the folder of the currently selected document, you can
          also highlight a #include directive and it will search for and
          try to open the file, include files surrounded by &lt;&gt;
          will be looked for in /usr/include, files surrounded by ""
          will be looked for in the current folder.<br>
          External tools can be added either globally or locally and
          when run can either replace the currently select text with
          their output, replace all the files text, be run in a terminal
          or you can choose to ignore the output form the script, BASH,
          python and perl can be used for the script language or any
          interpretor that uses '#' as a comment marker.<br>
          A number of simple demo scripts are included in the folder
          "demotoools" ( good name eh ).<br>
          You can drag and drop a file onto the main toolbar/menu to
          open a file.<br>
          Session can be saved and reloaded.<br>
          Any amount of bookmarks can be added anywhere, selecting a
          bookmark from the menu will switch to that tab and move to the
          appropriate line.<br>
          Just type a line number into the edit box on the toolbar to
          jump straight to that line.</font><br>

      <a name="navanc"></a><b>Navigation Menu</b><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">The Navigation menu has five sub-menus - Go To
        Definition, Open Include File, Go To Line, Search For Define and
        Search In Gtk-Docs.<br>
        <br>
        To go where a function etc is defined, select it and choose 'Go
        To Definition' KKEdit will then look in open files for the
        definition and switch to that page and highlight the appropriate
        line like so:</font> <br>
      <img alt="gotodefine" src="gotodefine.gif" width="479"
        height="266"><br>
      <br>
      <img alt="define" src="founddefine.gif" width="408" height="430"><br>
      <font size="-1">As you can see as the definition was not in an
        open file KKEdit looks for the definition recursively starting
        from the folder where the file was opened from and if found
        opening the file and selecting the line with the definition.<br>
        The search depth for finding a definition is set in the prefs
        and defaults to 1 i.e. only looks for definitions in files in
        the same folder as any open documents, be careful about setting
        this too high as it can cause an unwanted delay when right
        clicking if it has to look in a lot of sub-folders.<br>
        <br>
        You can also open an include file just highlight the line and
        select&nbsp; Open Include File like so:</font> <br>
      <img alt="openinclude" src="openinclude.gif" width="458"
        height="329"><br>
      <font size="-1">Include files are looked for in either
        /usr/include or the directory the current document is in,
        depending whether the file name is surrounded by '&lt;&gt;' or '
        "" '.<br>
        <br>
        Search for Define will open an entry box and allow you to type
        in a definition or part of a definition and will try to find it
        in the usual places opening a file if necessary, the search is
        case insensitive.</font> <br>

      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <a name="funcanc"></a><b>Functions Menu</b><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">The Functions menu contains a list of all defined
        functions, variables and defines that are visible in this file,
        to jump to the appropriate function definition just select it
        from the menu like so:</font><br>
      <img alt="funcmenu" src="functions.gif" width="869" height="465"><br>
      <font size="-1"> The Functions menu will be updated after saving a

      <a name="toolsanc"></a><b>Tools Menu</b><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">The Tools menu allow you to run an external script
        i.e. to open a terminal with the working directory set to the
        folder where the current file is open:</font><br>
      <img alt="openterm" src="toolsmenu.gif" width="872" height="638"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">External tools can either be added globally to
        /usr/share/KKEdit/tools (if you have installed with
        --prefix=/usr) or locally in ~/.KKEdit/tools.<br>
        External tools are passed four environment variables:<br>
        KKEDIT_CURRENTFILE - Path to current document.<br>
        KKEDIT_CURRENTDIR - Directory of current document.<br>
        KKEDIT_SELECTION - Currently selected text.</font> <font

        <br>
      </font><font size="-1">External tools are sorted by name in the
        menu and edit tools dialog.<br>
        External tools can be created by hand or via the 'Tools-&gt;New'
        menu like so:</font><br>
      <img alt="exttool" src="newtool.gif" width="640" height="700"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">The place holders are:<br>
        %t - Currently selected text, the same as the $KKEDIT_SELECTION
        environment variable passed to the command .<br>
        %f - Filepath of the current document, the same as the
        $KKEDIT_CURRENTFILE environment variable passed to the command.
        <br>
        %d - Directory of the current document or ${HOME}, the same as
        the $KKEDIT_CURRENTDIR environment variable passed to the
        command. <br>
        %i -The location of the globally installed tools, the same as
        the $KKEDIT_DATADIR environment variable passed to the command .<br>
        %h - Temporary file for displaying html in doc viewer, the same
        as the $KKEDIT_HTMLFILE environment variable passed to the
        command .<br>
        <br>
        Selecting 'View Output' will send the output of the tool to a
        pane in at the bottom of the editor, you can alter the size by
        dragging the handle and hide/show the pane from the 'View' menu,
        only stdout is captured from the output of the tool if you want
        to capture stderr you must redirect it to stdout, you can not
        capture stdin, if you need to interact with the tool use the '
        Run Tool In Terminal' option.<br>
        You can also optionally set a keyboard shortcut, just click in
        the shortcut box, hold CONTROL and press another key with or
        without SHIFT, to delete the shortcut just press the 'Delete'
        key.<br>
        <br>
        The output pane will be shown automatically for any tool that
        has this option selected, like so:<br>

        You can also display a progress bar from your tool by selecting
        the 'Use Prgress Bar' checkbox, a bar will be created for you
        and you can control it by writing simple commands to a file, the
        file path is contained in the environment variable
        '$KKEDIT_BAR_CONTROL", you can write either a simple number
        between 0 and 100 to set the gauge , 'pulse' to pulse the bar
        and 'quit' to kill the bar, you do not need to specifically
        write the 'quit' command as it will be sent automatically when
        your tool ends, N.B. if you set your tool to run asynchronously
        then you must send the 'quit' command your self.<br>
        There is an example of how to control the bar in the example
        tools in /usr/share/KKEdit/Example External Tools.</font><br>

          the real file, this is handy when using the 'Open' option from
          the tab menu as you will either select files to open from the
          folder the link is in or the folder were the real file is, try
          it and see it's a lot less complicated than it sounds!<br>

        <img alt="" src="addtoolbutton.gif" width="688" height="151"><br>

        Some items can only be added once 'Save', 'Open' etc when they
        have been added they will be greyed out and can't be added
        again, removing them makes them available again, the separator

        to add to the completion dialog by simpley creating the file
        ~/.KKEdit/customcompletions and adding words to it, the file
        MUST end in a newline, if the file does not exist no 'Custom
        Words' option will be shown.<br>
        Function and variable completions will show the definition when
        the 'Details' button is toggled on, custom and document words
        have no extra details. <br>
        <br>
      </font><b>Create </b><b>D</b><b>ocumentation with Doxygen</b><br>
      <img alt="" src="docs.gif" width="808" height="636"><br>
      <font size="-1">You can create documentation for your code if you
        have doxygen installed by selecting "Create Documentation" from
        the 'File' menu, the documentation will be created in the
        current folder and displayed with either the built in docviewer
        or the system browser, the first time you run this there may be
        a small delay while the initial files are created by doxygen,
        after that selecting "Create Documentation" again just updates
        the files, if there is not a file a called 'Doxyfile' in the
        current folder a default config file is created for you, this
        file can manually edited to suit your needs, I would recommend
        that you also install Graphviz for the nice fancy flow charts,
        most distros will have packages for these two apps.<br>
        If doxygen is NOT installed you won't have a "Create
        Documentation" menu, just install it and ( optionally ) Graphviz
        and restart KKEdit and the menu will appear.</font><br>
      <br>
      <b>Document Integration</b><br>
      <font size="-1">There is some integration with the documents
        crated by doxygen when, and only when using the built in
        docview, select 'Documentation' form the 'File' menu and the doc
        viewer will appear as above, there may be a bit of a delay the
        first time you use this function while doxygen creates all the
        necessary files, subsequent uses will be much faster as doxygen
        will just update the needed files.<br>
        Click on the 'Files' tab to get a list of files, then SHIFT
        click on a file name like so:<br>
        <img alt="" src="clickfile.gif" width="359" height="447">&nbsp;
      </font><br>
      <font size="-1">The doc viewer will open the page and the editor
        will also either open the file or switch to the appropriate tab
        like so:<br>
      </font>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="edswitch.gif" width="374"
        height="240"><br>
      <img alt="" src="docswitch.gif" width="626" height="477"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">Select a function for instance:</font><br>
      <img alt="" src="funclick.gif" width="464" height="496"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">Shows this:</font><br>
      <img alt="" src="gotofuncclick.gif" width="825" height="677"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="-1">From here you can SHIFT click on the line number (
        RED ) to open the file/switch tab and goto the line in the
        editor and the docs like so:</font><br>
      <img alt="" src="sourceclicked.gif" width="573" height="180"><br>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="editsrcclicked.gif" width="572" height="487"><br>
      <font size="-1">Shift clicking the file name ( BLUE ) will open
        the file or switch tabs as above.<br>
        Clicking a reference ( GREEN ) will go to the documentaion for
        that refence where you can again select a line number/file etc.<br>
        You can also click on the various graph box's to go to a
        function definition.<br>
        You can open a file by SHIFT clicking on a box in the include
        dependency graph for a file like so:<br>
        <img alt="" src="clickopen.gif" width="406" height="552"><br>
        This will open the file or switch to the relevant tab as above.<br>
        You can tweak the default doxyfile to add more/less info to the
        browser.<br>
        <br>
        The main change you will want to make to the file 'Doxyfile' is
        to change the project name so open then file 'doxyfile' which
        will be in the same folder as your source&nbsp; code and change
        the line "PROJECT_NAME="My Project"" to somthing more
        appropriate.<br>
        At the moment the documentation MUST&nbsp; be left in the html
        folder created in the folder with your source code, this will
        probably cjange later to allow you to set the folder for the
        documentation.<br>
        If you want more information on the various options available in
        the doxyfile run 'doxygen -g' from the command line and a
        default Doxyfile will be created which is heavily commented.</font><br>

        KKedit now supports simple 'c' plugins, an example plugin is
        available on the plugins page, this will add a menu item to the
        'Help' menu which will display all the currently supported
        features of the plugin system this is still a work in progress
        so bugs and suggestions are welcome, I will be adding extra
        plugins that will be available from this site but if you write a
        plugin or just have an idea for one please let me know.<br>
        <br>
        Plugins can be enabled/disabled from the 'Plugin Prefs' menu
        from the 'Edit' menu.<br>
        <img alt="" src="plugprefs.gif" width="366" height="279"> <br>
        <br>
        There are two plugin folders that will be searched for plugins:
        /usr/share/KKEdit/plugins and ~/.KKEdit/plugins, plugins can be
        in subfolders and should be named like 'libPLUGNAME.so'<br>
        See the installed example plugin for basic features and a basic
        Makefile.<br>
