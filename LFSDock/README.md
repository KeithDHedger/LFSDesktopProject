This will be a simple dock.<br>
Far from finished yet, usable but can only launch apps.<br>
Much more to come!.<br>

Getting functionality working first, fancy graphics later.<br>

Gadgets:<br>
In the gadets list in ~/.config/LFS/lfsdock.rc and the prefs dialog, you can use:<br>
L - Any .desktop files in ~/.config/LFS/launchers-DOCK.<br>
C - Clock.<br>
S - Alsa volume slider.<br>
D - Desktop switcher.<br>
s - Space.<br>
T - Task list.<br>
<br>
N.B.<br>
The tasklist needs to be included for the task switcher but the tasks are always on the right side of the dock.<br>
Right click on a launcher for a simple context menu.<br>
Clicking a launcher will either launch the app or if already launched bring it to front.<br>
Selecting 'Launch' from the right click menu will attemt to launch an new instance, ( some single instance apps will override this ).<br>
<br>
You can use 's' for spaces as many times as you want.<br>
<br>
Gadgets can be in any order you wish.<br>
<br>
More gadgets to come and improvements to the graphics.<br>
The dock looks best with a transparent background.<br>
