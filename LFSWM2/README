LFSWM2 has now replaced LFSWmanager and is pretty much done.

TODO
Need configure app ( at the moment configure is via file ~/.config/LFS/lfswm2.rc ).
Needs some graphics tweaking for full screen desktop windows and full screen "ABOVE" windows.
Needs some code cleaning.
Switch desktops via mouse thumb wheeel.
