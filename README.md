INFORMATION!

LFSWM2 Should be used in place of LFSWManager.

Non essential files  have been removed from the repo, you now need to use ( for example )./autogen --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

The best way to do a full install is to use the "makeall" script in this folder ie:<br>
sudo ./makeall deploy

There are other options to the script but they are mainly for my use whilst developing, use at your own risk.
