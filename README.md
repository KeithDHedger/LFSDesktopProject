# LFSDesktopProject
A low resource/dependency desktop for Linux From Scratch

Although designed for Linux From Scratch has been tested on Slackware and XUbuntu briefly.

Documentation is autogenerated by doxygen.

CD to LFSDesktopProject/LFSToolKit/LFSToolKit/lfstk and run:
````

doxygen

````
To update docs.

Alternativly there is a prebuilt docset for use with zeal in the main folder.

INFORMATION!

LFSWM2 Should be used in place of LFSWManager.

Non essential files  have been removed from the repo, you now need to use ( for example )./autogen --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

The best way to do a full install is to use the "makeall" script in this folder ie:
````

sudo ./makeall deploy

````

There are other options to the script but they are mainly for my use whilst developing, use at your own risk.

Some screen shots:

Showng dual monitor backdrops, multople docks, multiple panels and systray.
